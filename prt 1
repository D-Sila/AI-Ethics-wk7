Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination produced by AI systems due to biased data, flawed assumptions, or design choices that disadvantage certain individuals or groups.

Examples:

Hiring Algorithms: An AI trained on historical hiring data may favor male candidates if past hiring decisions were biased against women (e.g., Amazon’s recruiting tool).

Criminal Justice Systems: Risk assessment tools like COMPAS may assign higher recidivism risk scores to minority groups due to biased policing and arrest data.
Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

Transparency refers to openness about how an AI system is built and used, including data sources, model type, and decision processes.

Explainability refers to the ability to provide understandable reasons for specific AI decisions or predictions.

Importance:

Transparency builds trust and accountability.

Explainability allows users and regulators to challenge decisions, detect bias, and comply with legal requirements (e.g., GDPR’s “right to explanation”).

Both are essential for ethical, trustworthy, and human-centric AI systems.

Q3: How does GDPR impact AI development in the EU?

GDPR significantly impacts AI development by:

Enforcing data protection and privacy principles (lawfulness, fairness, minimization).

Granting individuals rights such as access, correction, erasure, and objection to automated decision-making.

Restricting fully automated decisions with significant effects unless safeguards (e.g., human oversight) are in place.

As a result, AI systems in the EU must be privacy-preserving, explainable, and accountable by design.
